## Prereqs
> To make sure this program runs as designed Python 3.8 
> should be installed. Also any of the required modules
> need to be installed. I recommend simply googling the module 
> name and finding the documentation. The PIP command for installation 
> is usually one of the first things mentioned. Also with Python it is 
> common to have multiple modules with similar names. So if errors are 
> being raised about not having a certain module it is most likely the 
> wrong module with a similar name to the one that is required was installed 
> instead of the required module.

## Installation
> Google Python downloads and obtain version 3.8 from the
> official website. Run the installer and follow the default
> installation procedures. Also Google any required modules and
> install them with PIP in Command Prompt.

## Purpose
> This is a simple, yet very functional program designed to
> make the process of gathering screenshots a piece of cake.
> It automates screenshots using a keyboard listener to control
> whether it the program starts, stops, or exits. This program
> will loop as many times as desired.
